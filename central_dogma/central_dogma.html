        <h1>The RNA Revolution: Rewriting the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p><strong>For decades, we believed DNA makes RNA, RNA makes protein, and proteins determine our traits. This simple model only explains about 2% of inheritance. Welcome to the RNA revolution.</strong></p>

        <img src="central_dogma_genomics.png" alt="Central Dogma of Molecular Biology" class="featured-image">

        <h2>Beyond the Traditional View</h2>
        <p>The central dogma of molecular biology elegantly explained genetic information flow—DNA codes for RNA, which creates proteins. But this framework, while foundational, tells only a fraction of the story.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Key Discovery:</strong> More than 95% of the human genome encodes functionally diverse non-coding RNAs, elevating the true gene count by at least tenfold. What was dismissed as "junk DNA" is actually essential regulatory machinery.
        </div>

        <h2>The Junk DNA That Wasn't Junk</h2>
        <p>The Human Genome Project revealed a puzzle: humans have only ~20,000 protein-coding genes—less than 2% of our genome. Scientists initially dismissed the remaining 98% as evolutionary debris. Modern research proves this assumption spectacularly wrong.</p>
        <p>Non-coding RNAs aren't genetic junk—they're master regulators orchestrating cellular life with remarkable precision and complexity.</p>

        <h2>RNA's Expanded Roles</h2>
        <h3>Regulatory Control</h3>
        <p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) silence or fine-tune gene expression by binding to messenger RNAs, controlling protein production with exquisite precision.</p>

        <h3>Chromosomal Architecture</h3>
        <p>Long non-coding RNAs organize the three-dimensional structure of chromosomes, determining which genes are accessible and which remain silent.</p>

        <h3>Epigenetic Modification</h3>
        <p>RNA molecules guide enzymes that chemically modify DNA, creating heritable changes in gene activity without altering the DNA sequence itself.</p>

        <h3>Catalytic Activity</h3>
        <p>Some RNAs function as enzymes (ribozymes), directly catalyzing reactions. These molecules blur the line between genotype and phenotype.</p>

        <h3>Information Transfer</h3>
        <p>RNAs move between cells and even organisms through extracellular vesicles, carrying regulatory instructions across cellular and species boundaries.</p>

        <h2>The Expanded Central Dogma</h2>
        <p>The classical dogma portrayed linear information flow: DNA → RNA → Protein. The expanded model reveals something far more dynamic—a multidirectional network where all biomolecules interact in complex feedback loops.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reverse Information Flow:</strong> RNA can serve as a template for DNA synthesis through reverse transcription</li>
            <li><strong>RNA-Directed DNA Modification:</strong> RNAs guide enzymes to modify DNA methylation and chromatin structure</li>
            <li><strong>Structural Plasticity:</strong> RNA sequences fold into different structures based on cellular conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Molecular Moonlighting:</strong> Single RNAs perform multiple, sometimes contradictory functions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        
        <h3>Medicine and Therapeutics</h3>
        <p>mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 showcased RNA's therapeutic potential. We can now program cells to produce any designed protein. RNA interference therapies silence disease-causing genes with unprecedented precision.</p>

        <h3>Cancer Research</h3>
        <p>Most cancer-associated mutations occur in regulatory regions, not protein-coding genes. Understanding RNA expression patterns provides new therapeutic targets.</p>

        <h3>Evolutionary Biology</h3>
        <p>RNA modifications and regulatory changes generate new phenotypes rapidly, explaining how organisms adapt faster than DNA mutation rates would predict.</p>

        <h3>Heredity Beyond DNA</h3>
        <p>Epigenetic modifications guided by RNAs can be inherited across generations, creating inheritance layers beyond DNA sequence. Environmental experiences can alter RNA-mediated gene regulation in ways affecting offspring.</p>

        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
        <p>The RNA revolution doesn't invalidate the central dogma—it enriches it. We now recognize biomolecules participating in an intricate, multidirectional conversation where RNA plays a starring role as conductor, regulator, and performer.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>The Bottom Line:</strong> If the 20th century was the age of DNA, the 21st century belongs to RNA. The molecule once dismissed as a mere messenger has revealed itself as a master regulator, rewriting the fundamental rules of life itself.
